# Creating an animation in Blender for a HUD object

___

> Attention: This tutorial corresponds to TheParaziT's animation method and may differ from other animators' methods!

## Getting Started

1. The tutorial assumes that you know Blender!

2. learn the animation extensions (.anm, .skl, .skls, .omf)

3. learn the terminology (HUD).

4. You will need a Rig for the animations (for example a Rig from TheParaziT or Ichigrow)

## Customizing a HUD object

Import the object you need, that will become a HUD object

Now we have to create a Rig for it:

1. We create the armature and the necessary bones.

2. In the HUD object we create Vertex Groups with the names of our bones
